# Cycles
HTML5 Canvas Game, Cycles - a suspenseful math learning experience

## Gameplay Instructions
Cycles is a simplistic, but challenging, mathematical learning game for anyone looking to improve their basic multiplication skills or anyone who enjoys playing quick, exciting games. The objective is to survive longer than the enemy. The player controls the red cycle and the computer controls the blue cycle.

If either cycle runs into any trail or line, including the center boundary, it will be destroyed and that player will lose the game.
Cycles move forward automatically and only require the player to turn them. In order to steer your cycle you must solve the mathematical operation that corresponds with the direction which you would like to turn.

For example, at the start of the game you are given these four operations shown below in the center boundary (The smaller box within the center boundary is the input box where you type in the answer). If you want your cycle to change direction and move left, you must solve '8 x 10' because it is on the left side of the input box. Similarly if you want your cycle to move right then you would need to solve '1 x 9' because it is to the right of the input box. Same logic applies to changing the cycle's direction up or down.

Type in the numerical answer (supports num pad inputs) then press 'Enter' to submit your answer. If your answer is correct, the cycle will change direction, otherwise it will continue moving in the same direction.
